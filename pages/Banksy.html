            <p> There have been speculations that the graffiti found at the stairway to the crossover of the trains on Gainsborough St is a Bansky project. Stylistically this work does share a lot in common with Banksy’s other artworks, the limited color palette of white, black, and gray tones with an accent of red, the realistic figure style, and the charged message that the work carries. However, I do not believe that this was done by Banksy.</p>

            <p> In terms of the art style, Banksy works are more reductive. It looks as though this artist had the time to make white, black, and gray stencils giving the colors a rigid definition of form when compared to Banksy works which appear to only have white and black stencils with the gray being used more freely to create a softer transition of values. In terms of the topic the work addresses there is another rift between this and Banksy’s work. The meaning I draw from looking at this piece is that a kid was caught in the act of being paid to graffiti “I <3 Boston” on the walls lending to the idea of propaganda making the city seem greater than it actually is. Banksy’s works, on the other hand, have more charge and personality to them, doing things as ballsy as shredding a multimillion dollar artwork right after being sold or as simple as writing “This looks a bit like an elephant” on a water tank in a random hill by the side of a highway. This particular work definitely lacks that level of idiosyncrasy. Other stylistic elements that are disparate between this work and Banksy’s is the use of text. In this case the artist used text both to add meaning and describe what exactly was going on. Banksy’s works rarely use text, and when it does it is only to drive home a message as the pictorial elements need no further explanation.</p>
